# Royale Proxy API

![Royale Proxy API Logo](art/logo.jpg)

Welcome to the Royale Proxy API, your gateway to seamless integration with the official [Clash Royale API](https://developer.clashroyale.com/). Built with the robust [Nuxt.js](https://nuxt.com/), this project simplifies your development process by eliminating the need for IP whitelisting.

## üåü Motivation

The official Clash Royale API requires you to whitelist your server's IP address, which is a significant hurdle for building with the API. Royale Proxy API acts as a bridge, forwarding your requests to the official API without the need for whitelisting every connected client.

You just need to whitelist the server ip and provide the key, and let the server handle the rest!

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Get your API key** from the [Clash Royale Developer Portal](https://developer.clashroyale.com/).
2. **Whitelist your server or local IP address** on the developer portal.
3. **Clone this repository** and install the dependencies.
4. **Copy the `.env.example` file** to `.env` and add your API key.
5. **Run the development server** and start making requests!
